    They say he likes a good time (my, oh, my)
    He comes alive at midnight (every night)
    My mama doesn't trust him (my, oh, my)
    He's only here for one thing, but (so am I)
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Yeah, a little bit older, a black leather jacket
    A bad reputation, insatiable habits
    He was onto me, one look and I couldn't breathe, yeah
    I said, if he kissed me, I might let it happen (oh)   
</p>
<br>
<p>
    I swear on my life that I've been a good girl (oh)
    Tonight, I don't wanna be her
